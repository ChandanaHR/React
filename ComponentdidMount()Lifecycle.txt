The lifecycle refers to the various stages a component goes through. These stages allow developers to run specific code at key moments, such as when the component is created, updated, or removed
There are three main phases of the React component lifecycle
Mounting - Initialization, renders, and mounts the component (componentDidMount())
Updation - Forprops(getDerivedStateFromProps) : ForState(setState()) (componentDidUpdate())
ComponentWillUnMount()

Mounting - Mounting refers to the process of creating and inserting a component into the DOM for the first time in a React application
componentDidMount() - In React, componentDidMount() is a lifecycle method in React that is called once a component has been rendered and placed in the DOM. This method is invoked only once during the 
lifecycle of a component, immediately after the first render, which is why it is useful for operations like fetching data, setting up subscriptions, and interacting with the DOM.
           
//Welcome.jsx file
import React from 'react';
class Welcome extends React.Component{
    //The constructor() is the first method called when the component is created.
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        //super(props) calls the parent class constructor and gives access to this.props.
        this.state = {
            message : "Loading...."
        };
        //Initializes state with a property called message.
        console.log("Component is being created");
    }
    componentDidMount() {
    console.log('componentDidMount: Component has been mounted');
    // Simulate data loading
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({ message: 'Welcome to React!' });
    }, 2000);
  }
  render() {
    console.log('Render: Component is rendering');
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>{this.state.message}</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

//Note: In React class components, the lifecycle begins when the component is instantiated (created) â€” and this happens in the constructor().
//1)constructor: Component is created,initial state is set=>But component is not added to DOM
//2)render: JSX is returned to be displayed.=>Right after construction, before mounting.
//3)DOM is updated: React inserts the component into the DOM.=>After render.
//4)componentDidMount()	Runs after component is mounted.	=>Perfect for AJAX/data fetching.

//App.jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg'
import viteLogo from '/vite.svg'
import './App.css'
import Welcome from "./Welcome"

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React app</h1>
      <Welcome/>
    </div>
  )
}
export default App
